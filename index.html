		  				About Me
		  			</h2>
		  			<h3>
		  				Hello! My name is Joe Glatman Zaretsky, and I am applying to participate in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program, starting in October.  A little background: I am originally from New York City; I grew up in Brooklyn.  I attended Macalester College in St. Paul, MN, where I double-majored in Economics and Classical Languages.  I stayed in Minnesota for another year and a half after college to work as a Global Sourcing Business Analyst at Target.  I moved to Washington DC 3 years ago to work as a Senior Strategy Analyst at The Advisory Board Company.  I have long been interested in web development, and I recently began to teach myself the basics.  Given the amount that I've enjoyed it, the next step is for me to participate in General Assembly's class and pursue a new career path.
